This project is going to be a browser tic tac toe game. Initially it will be a two player game and then I will create some form of computer opponent. The intention of this project is to work on using factory functions and the module pattern to keep the ammount of code needed to a minimum.





when the page loads, there is a prompt, where the two users enter their name. then we flip a coin to see who goes first.there will be a box on either side of the board where the scores will be. play a round, score updates, board clears out,winner starts next round, play up to 5.
